This is a small experiment with Ports and Adapters architecture! 

To check the two different "modes" (production with `axios` and local with local data) try running `npm start` and `npm run production`. 

The first will open up in port 3000 and the second in port 5000. These ports of course are not the Ports from the architecture :D
